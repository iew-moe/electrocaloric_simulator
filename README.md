# An interactive simulator of electrocaloric heat pumps
- Runs in a web browser (Pyodide + Plotly)
- Simulation of heat transfer by convection and by mass transport from fluid pumping, including heat exchangers
- Simulation of half-bridge power electronics to change the voltage and trigger the electrocaloric effect
